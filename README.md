# NUS Library Proxy

Userscript alternative to the NUS bookmarklet. Adds http://libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/login?url= into all urls defined in the script to gain full-text journal access. This will send you to the NUS Library Proxy login page if you are not already logged in.

## Installation
This would require either [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) to be installed for their respective browsers. The script can then be installed by opening the script in your web browser and clicking on the "Open raw" button.
